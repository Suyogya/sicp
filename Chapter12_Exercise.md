## 1.9
Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

```lisp
(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0)
        b
        (inc (+ (dec a) b))
    )
)

(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0)
        b
        (+ (dec a) (inc b))
    )
)
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

### Answer
Using the first definition
```lisp
(+ 4 5)
;(inc (+ (dec 4) 5)))
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```

This is recursive process

Uing the second definition
```lisp
(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```
This is iterative process

## 1.10
The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Akermann's function

```lisp
(define (A x y)
    (cond ((= y 0) 0)
          ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
          ((= y 1) 2)
          (else (A (- x 1)
                (A x (- y 1)))
          )
    )
)
```

What are the values of the following expressions?
```lisp
(A 1 10)
(A 2 4)
(A 3 3)
```

Consider the following procedures, where A is the procedure defined above:

```lisp
(define (f n) (A 0 n))

(define (g n) (A 1 n))

(define (h n) (A 2 n))

(define (k n) (* 5 n n))
```
Give concise mathematical definitions for the functions computed by the procedures f, g, and h for positive integer values of n. For example, (k n) computes 5n2.

 function f is defined by the rule that f(n) = n if n<3 and f(n) = f(n - 1) + 2f(n - 2) + 3f(n - 3) if n &ge; 3. Write a procedure that computes f by means of a recursive process. Write a procedure that computes f by means of an iterative process.

### Answer
Recursive:

```lisp
(define (f11-recur n)
    (if (< n 3)
        n
        (+ (f11-recur (- n 1))

The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle.

```
             1
            1 1
           1 2 1
          1 3 3 1
         1 4 6 4 1
            ...
```

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process.

### Answer
```lisp
(define (pascal r c)
   (cond ((or (= c 0) (= r c)) 1)
         ((or (< c 0) (< r c)) 0)
          (else (+ (pascal (- r 1) (- c 1))
                   (pascal (- r 1) c)

### 1.13
Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to &phi;<sup>n</sup>/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>, where &phi; = (1 + 5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>)/2. Hint: Let &Psi; = (1 - 5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>)/2. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers to prove that Fib(n) = (&phi;<sup>n</sup> - &Psi;<sup>n</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>.
For the first part, define:
```lisp
(define phi (/ (+ 1 (sqrt 5)) 2))

(define (phi-fib n)
    (/ (^ phi n) (sqrt 5))
)
 ```

```lisp
=> (phi-fib 1)
.7236067059356593
;~= 1

=> (phi-fib 2)
1.1708205768786706

=> (phi-fib 3)
1.8944280256081427

;~= 3

=> (phi-fib 5)
4.959679774621483
;~= 5
```

To prove using induction

&phi;<sup>2</sup> = &phi; + 1<br>
&phi; = (1 + &phi;)/&phi;<br>
&phi; = 1 + 1/&phi;

&Psi;<sup>2</sup> = &Psi; + 1<br>
&Psi; = (1 + &Psi;)/&Psi;<br>
&Psi; = 1 + 1/&Psi;

Fib (0) = 0<br>
Fib (1) = 1<br>
Fib (2) = 1<br>

Using formula (F(n) = (&phi;<sup>n</sup> - &Psi;<sup>n</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>)<br>

Fib (0) = (&phi;<sup>0</sup> - &Psi;<sup>0</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (0) = (1 - 1)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (0) = 0/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (0) = 0


Fib (1) = (&phi;<sup>1</sup> - &Psi;<sup>1</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (1) = (&phi; - &Psi;)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (1) = (((1 + 5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>)/2) - (1 - 5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>)/2)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (1) = (2.5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>)/2)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (1) = 1

Fib (2) = (&phi;<sup>2</sup> - &Psi;<sup>2</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (2) = ((1 + 5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>)/2)<sup>2</sup> - ((1 - 5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>)/2)<sup>2</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (2) = ((1 + 5 + 2.5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>)/4 - (1 + 5 - 2.5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>)/4)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (2) = (4.5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>/4)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
Fib (2) = 1

Let's say,

for n,<br>
Fib (n) = (&phi;<sup>n</sup> - &Psi;<sup>n</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>

and n - 1<br>
(&phi;<sup>n - 1</sup> - &Psi;<sup>n - 1</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>

Then for n + 1,<br>
F (n + 1) = F(n) + F(n - 1)<br>
= (&phi;<sup>n</sup> - &Psi;<sup>n</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup> + (&phi;<sup>n - 1</sup> - &Psi;<sup>n - 1</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
= (&phi;<sup>n</sup> + &phi;<sup>n - 1</sup> -(&Psi;<sup>n</sup> + &Psi;<sup>n - 1</sup>))/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
= (&phi;<sup>n + 1</sup>(&phi;<sup>-1</sup> + &phi;<sup>-2</sup>) - &Psi;<sup>n + 1</sup>(&Psi;<sup>-1</sup> + &Psi;<sup>-2</sup>))/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
= (&phi;<sup>n + 1</sup>.&phi;<sup>-1</sup>(1 + &phi;<sup>-1</sup>) - &Psi;<sup>n + 1</sup>.&Psi;<sup>-1</sup>(1 + &Psi;<sup>-1</sup>))/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
= (&phi;<sup>n + 1</sup>.(1/&phi;).(1 + 1/&phi;) - &Psi;<sup>n + 1</sup>.(1/&Psi;).(1 + 1/&Psi;))/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
= (&phi;<sup>n + 1</sup>.(1/&phi;).&phi; - &Psi;<sup>n + 1</sup>.(1/&Psi;).&Psi;)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup><br>
= (&phi;<sup>n + 1</sup> - &Psi;<sup>n + 1</sup>)/5<sup>&#xbd;</sup>

##1.15
The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation sin x  x if x is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity

sin x = 3 sin x/3 - 4 sin<sup>3</sup> x/3

to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered ``sufficiently small'' if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:
```lisp
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a.  How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?

b.  What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

### Answer
a)

```lisp
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine 1.35)))
(p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))
(p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))
...
...
```

p is applied 5 times

b)
Let, 3<sup>x</sup> = 10.a

we apply p once for each power of 3 within 10 times angle a (since we get down to 0.1)

log (3<sup>x</sup>) = log(10.a)<br> (base 10 log)
x. log(3) = log 10 + log a<br>
x = (1 + log a)/log 3<br>
x = C<sub>1</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>Log(a)

So we can say, the order of growth is,<br>
&theta;(log(a))

The order of growth is same for both time and space since they're both determined by number of times we need to apply `p`.


## 1.16
Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that uses successive squaring and uses a logarithmic number of steps, as does fast-expt. (Hint: Using the observation that (bn/2)2 = (b2)n/2, keep, along with the exponent n and the base b, an additional state variable a, and define the state transformation in such a way that the product a bn is unchanged from state to state. At the beginning of the process a is taken to be 1, and the answer is given by the value of a at the end of the process. In general, the technique of defining an invariant quantity that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.)

### Answer
```lisp
(define (fast-expt-iter b n)
    (define (iter a num p)
        (cond ((= p 0) a)
              ((even? p) (iter a (square num) (/ p 2)))
              (else  (iter (* num a) num (- p 1)))
        )
    )
    (iter 1 b n)
)
```

## 1.17
The exponentiation algorithms in this section are based on performing exponentiation by means of repeated multiplication. In a similar way, one can perform integer multiplication by means of repeated addition. The following multiplication procedure (in which it is assumed that our language can only add, not multiply) is analogous to the expt procedure:
```lisp
(define (* a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      0
      (+ a (* a (- b 1)))))
```
This algorithm takes a number of steps that is linear in b. Now suppose we include, together with addition, operations double, which doubles an integer, and halve, which divides an (even) integer by 2. Using these, design a multiplication procedure analogous to fast-expt that uses a logarithmic number of steps.

### Answer
b * a = (2 * b) * (a / 2) (when a is even)<br>
b * a = b + (2 *b) * ((a - 1)/2) (when a is odd)<br>

```lisp
(define (fast-expt b n)
    (cond ((= n 0) 1)
          ((even? n) (square (expt b (/ n 2))))
          (else (* b (expt b (- n 1))))
    )
)
```

## 1.18

    (define (iter result y z)

    (iter 0 a b)

## 1.19
There is a clever algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic number of steps. Recall the transformation of the state variables a and b in the fib-iter process of section 1.2.2: a  a + b and b  a. Call this transformation T, and observe that applying T over and over again n times, starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair Fib(n + 1) and Fib(n). In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are produced by applying Tn, the nth power of the transformation T, starting with the pair (1,0). Now consider T to be the special case of p = 0 and q = 1 in a family of transformations Tpq, where Tpq transforms the pair (a,b) according to a bq + aq + ap and b  bp + aq. Show that if we apply such a transformation Tpq twice, the effect is the same as using a single transformation Tp'q' of the same form, and compute p' and q' in terms of p and q. This gives us an explicit way to square these transformations, and thus we can compute Tn using successive squaring, as in the fast-expt procedure. Put this all together to complete the following procedure, which runs in a logarithmic number of steps:

```lisp
(define (fib n)
  (fib-iter 1 0 0 1 n))
(define (fib-iter a b p q count)
  (cond ((= count 0) b)
        ((even? count)
         (fib-iter a
                   b
                   <??>      ; compute p'
                   <??>      ; compute q'
                   (/ count 2)))
        (else (fib-iter (+ (* b q) (* a q) (* a p))
                        (+ (* b p) (* a q))
                        p
                        q
                        (- count 1)))))
```

Applying transformation T<sub>pq</sub> on a b<br>
a <- bq + ap + aq<br>
b <- bp + aq

Applying transformation T<sub>pq</sub> again on a,<br>
a <- (bp + aq)q + (bq + ap + aq)p + (bq + ap + aq)q<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <- bpq + aq&sup2; + bpq + ap&sup2; + apq + bq&sup2; + apq + aq&sup2;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <- b(q&sup2; + 2pq) + a(p&sup2; + q&sup2;) + a(q&sup2; + 2pq)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <- bq' + ap' + aq'

This gives us,
p' = (p&sup2; + q&sup2;)
q' = (q&sup2; + 2pq)

In addition, applying transform T<sub>pq</sub> again on b,<br>
b <- (bp + aq)p + (bq + ap + aq)q<br>

#### Explanation

Fibonacci is a Transformation T such that,<br>
a <- a + b<br>
b <- a<br>

After applying T n times T<sup>n</sup> we get,<br>
a = Fib(n+1)<br>
b = Fib (n)<br>

Considering T as a special case of T<sub>pq</sub> such that,<br>
a <- bq + ap + aq<br>
b <- bp + aq<br>
Where, p = 0 and q = 1 (which when substituted results in Transformation T,  a <- a + b and b <- a)<br>

We can say that Fib (n+1) and Fib(n) is applying (T<sub>pq</sub>)<sup>n</sup> transformation.<br>
(T<sub>pq</sub>)<sup>n</sup> = ((T<sub>pq</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>n/2</sup> (when n is even)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= (T<sub>p'q'</sub>)<sup>n/2</sup><br>
(T<sub>pq</sub>)<sup>n</sup> = T<sub>pq</sub>(T<sub>pq</sub>)<sup>n - 1</sup> (when n is odd)


## 1.20
 The process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the rules used by the interpreter. As an example, consider the iterative gcd procedure given above. Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order evaluation, as discussed in section 1.1.5. (The normal-order-evaluation rule for if is described in exercise 1.5.) Using the substitution method (for normal order), illustrate the process generated in evaluating (gcd 206 40) and indicate the remainder operations that are actually performed. How many remainder operations are actually performed in the normal-order evaluation of (gcd 206 40)? In the applicative-order evaluation?

### Answer

Using normal-order evaluation
```lisp
(gcd 206 40)
(if (= 40 0) 206
    (gcd 40
         (remainder 206 40)
    )
)

(gcd 40
    (remainder 206 40)
)

(if (= (remainder 206 40) 0)
    40
    (gcd (remainder 206 40) 
         (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
    )
)

(if (= 6 0) ... )

(gcd (remainder 206 40) 
    (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
)

(if (= (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) 0)
    (remainder 206 40)
    (gcd (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
         (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
    )
)

(if (= 4 0) ...)

(gcd (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
    (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
)

```

Using applicative-order evaluation

 ```lisp
(gcd 206 40)
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
(gcd 40 6)
(gcd 6 (remainder 40 6))
(gcd 6 4)
(gcd 4 (remainder 6 4))
(gcd 4 2)
(gcd 2 (remainder 4 2))
(gcd 2 0)
2

 ```

 ## 1.21
Use the smallest-divisor procedure to find the smallest divisor of each of the following numbers: 199, 1999, 19999

### Answer
```lisp
1 ]=> (smallest-divisor 199)

;Value: 199

1 ]=> (smallest-divisor 1999)

;Value: 1999

1 ]=> (smallest-divisor 19999)

;Value: 7

```


## 1.22
Most Lisp implementations include a primitive called runtime that returns an integer that specifies the amount of time the system has been running (measured, for example, in microseconds). The following timed-prime-test procedure, when called with an integer n, prints n and checks to see if n is prime. If n is prime, the procedure prints three asterisks followed by the amount of time used in performing the test.

```lisp
(define (timed-prime-test n)
  (newline)
  (display n)
  (start-prime-test n (runtime)))
(define (start-prime-test n start-time)
  (if (prime? n)
      (report-prime (- (runtime) start-time))))
(define (report-prime elapsed-time)
  (display " *** ")
  (display elapsed-time))
```

Using this procedure, write a procedure search-for-primes that checks the primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified range. Use your procedure to find the three smallest primes larger than 1000; larger than 10,000; larger than 100,000; larger than 1,000,000. Note the time needed to test each prime. Since the testing algorithm has order of growth of (n), you should expect that testing for primes around 10,000 should take about 10 times as long as testing for primes around 1000. Do your timing data bear this out? How well do the data for 100,000 and 1,000,000 support the n prediction? Is your result compatible with the notion that programs on your machine run in time proportional to the number of steps required for the computation?

### Answer
Modified the program as follows
```lisp

(define (timed-prime-test n)
  (newline)
  (display n)
  (start-prime-test n (runtime))
)

(define (start-prime-test n start-time)
  (if (is-prime? n)
      (begin
          (report-prime (- (runtime) start-time))
          true
      )
      false
  )
)

(define (report-prime elapsed-time)
  (display " *** ")
  (display elapsed-time)
)

(define (search-for-prime a n)
    (define (iter number count)
        (if (< count n)
            (begin
                (if (timed-prime-test number)
                    (iter (+ number 2) (1+ count))
                    (iter (+ number 2) count) 
                )
            )
        )
    )
    (if (even? a)
        (iter (+ a 1) 0)
        (iter (+ a 2) 0)
    )
)
```

The time required to calculate the result did grow at the order of &Theta;(n<sup>1/2</sup>).

## Ex 1.23
The smallest-divisor procedure shown at the start of this section does lots of needless testing: After it checks to see if the number is divisible by 2 there is no point in checking to see if it is divisible by any larger even numbers. This suggests that the values used for test-divisor should not be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, .... To implement this change, define a procedure next that returns 3 if its input is equal to 2 and otherwise returns its input plus 2. Modify the smallest-divisor procedure to use (next test-divisor) instead of (+ test-divisor 1). With timed-prime-test incorporating this modified version of smallest-divisor, run the test for each of the 12 primes found in exercise 1.22. Since this modification halves the number of test steps, you should expect it to run about twice as fast. Is this expectation confirmed? If not, what is the observed ratio of the speeds of the two algorithms, and how do you explain the fact that it is different from 2?

### Answer

The new implementation of Smallest-divisor
```lisp
(define (smallest-divisor n)
    (define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
        (cond ((> (square test-divisor) n) n)
              ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)
              (else (find-divisor n (next test-divisor)))
        )
    )
    (define (divides? a b)
        (= (remainder b a) 0)
    )
    (define (next divisor)
        (if (even? divisor)
            (1+ divisor)
            (+ divisor 2)
        )
    )
    (find-divisor n 2)
)
```

Timing for search-for-prime after the change

```

It looks like we did gain some time but the ratio is around 1.5.

This is because of of the `next` procedure's `if` test

## 1.24
Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime? (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise. Since the Fermat test has (log n) growth, how would you expect the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to test primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out? Can you explain any discrepancy you find?

### Answer

```lisp

(define (timed-prime-test n)
  (newline)
  (display n)
  (start-prime-test n (runtime))
)

(define (start-prime-test n start-time)
  (if (fast-prime? n 100)
      (begin
          (report-prime (- (runtime) start-time))
          true
      )
      false
  )
)

(define (report-prime elapsed-time)
  (display " *** ")
  (display elapsed-time)
)

(define (search-for-prime a n)
    (define (iter number count)
        (if (< count n)
            (begin
                (if (timed-prime-test number)
                    (iter (+ number 2) (1+ count))
                    (iter (+ number 2) count) 
                )
            )
        )
    )
    (if (even? a)
        (iter (+ a 1) 0)
        (iter (+ a 2) 0)
    )
)
```

For small data, the growth is logarithmic. For huge numbers it grows faster because primitive arithmetic operations are more costly with huge numbers.

## 1.25

Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing expmod. After all, she says, since we already know how to compute exponentials, we could have simply written
```lisp
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))
```
Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester? Explain.

### Answer
When using this method, which is very straight forward, we are calculating number that are exponentially larger than m. The arithmetic operation on these huge numbers are costly.

Whereas, as explained in the expmod, the expmod procedure keeps the number we are operating on, smaller than m. Hence they are much faster.

## 1.26
Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty doing exercise 1.24. His fast-prime? test seems to run more slowly than his prime? test. Louis calls his friend Eva Lu Ator over to help. When they examine Louis's code, they find that he has rewritten the expmod procedure to use an explicit multiplication, rather than calling square:

```lisp
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
                       (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                    m))
        (else
         (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
                    m))))
```

`I don't see what difference that could make,` says Louis. `I do.` says Eva. `By writing the procedure like that, you have transformed the (log n) process into a (n) process.` Explain.

### Answer

This method procedure a tree recursion. Each argument of the multiplication have their own recursion tree and hence the execution time grows exponentially with the depth of the tree.

Hence, the order of growth is &Theta;(n) instead of &Theta; (log n) 


##  1.27
Demonstrate that the Carmichael numbers listed in footnote 47 really do fool the Fermat test. That is, write a procedure that takes an integer n and tests whether an is congruent to a modulo n for every a < n, and try your procedure on the given Carmichael numbers.

### Answer

```lisp

(define (carmichael n)
    (define (fermat-test a n)
        (= (expmod a n n) a)
    )
    (define (iter count)
        (cond ((= count n) true)
              ((fermat-test count n) (iter (1+ count)))
              (else false)
        )
    )
    (iter 1)
)
```

All of the Carmichael number fools Fermat's test

```lisp
1 ]=> (carmichael 561)

;Value: #t

1 ]=> (carmichael 1105)

;Value: #t

1 ]=> (carmichael 1729)

;Value: #t

1 ]=> (carmichael 2821)

1 ]=> (carmichael 6601)

;Value: #t

```

## 1.28
One variant of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled is called the Miller-Rabin test (Miller 1976; Rabin 1980). This starts from an alternate form of Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if n is a prime number and a is any positive integer less than n, then a raised to the (n - 1)st power is congruent to 1 modulo n. To test the primality of a number n by the Miller-Rabin test, we pick a random number a < n and raise a to the (n - 1)st power modulo n using the expmod procedure. However, whenever we perform the squaring step in expmod, we check to see if we have discovered a ``nontrivial square root of 1 modulo n,'' that is, a number not equal to 1 or n - 1 whose square is equal to 1 modulo n. It is possible to prove that if such a nontrivial square root of 1 exists, then n is not prime. It is also possible to prove that if n is an odd number that is not prime, then, for at least half the numbers a < n, computing an-1 in this way will reveal a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo n. (This is why the Miller-Rabin test cannot be fooled.) Modify the expmod procedure to signal if it discovers a nontrivial square root of 1, and use this to implement the Miller-Rabin test with a procedure analogous to fermat-test. Check your procedure by testing various known primes and non-primes. Hint: One convenient way to make expmod signal is to have it return 0.

### Answer

Miller-Rabin test<br>
If n is a prime number<br>
for positive integer a < n, a<sup>n - 1</sup> modulo n = 1 modulo n = 1

steps:
1. Pick a < n
2. a<sup>n - 1</sup> modulo n
3. when squaring if we find "nontrivieal square root of 1 modulo n", then it is not prime

Non Trivial square root a is:
- not equal to 1
- not equal to n - 1
- congruent to 1 modulo a


Also, for odd number, n, that is not prime, at least half the number a < n, computing a<sup> n -1</sup> will reveal nontrivial square root of 1 modulo n.

*Note - book reads: whose square is equal to 1 modulo n. However, it meant square is congruent 1 modulo n*

Another implementation,
```lisp
(define (expmod-mr base exp n)
    (define (square-non-trivial-check x)
        (let ((y (remainder (square x) n)))
            (if (and (not (= x 1)) (not (= x (- n 1))) (= y 1))
                0
                y
            )
        )
    )
    (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
          ((even? exp) (square-nontrivial-check (expmod-mr base (/ exp 2) n)))
          (else (remainder (* base (expmod-mr base (- exp 1) n)) n))
    )
)

(define (mr-test n)
    (define (check a)
        (= (expmod a (- n 1) n) 1)
    )
    (check (+ 1 (random-integer (- n 1))))
)

(define (mr-prime? n)
    (define (test a)
        (cond ((= a 0) true)
              ((mr-test n) (test (- a 1)))
              (else false)
        )
    )
    (if (= n 1) #f (test 100))
)
```

#### Explanation
From Fermat's little theorem we have, for a < n,<br>
a<sup>n</sup> &cong; a (mod n)<br>
Dividing both sides by a
a<sup>n - 1</sup> &cong; 1 (mod n)
